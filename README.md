Welcome to my Portfolio project. The aim is to build a booking system with both users and properties.

We'll be using TDD methodology during this process, using SQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS technologies!

## Instructions

To run SQL queries, use the below code at the base working folder with the file you'd like to run.
For example

```
psql -f db/01-create-database.sql
```
